# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a **Loan Approval Prediction Model** using machine learning techniques. We experimented with multiple models. The models analyze **applicant data** such as income, credit history, and loan amount to predict whether a loan should be approved.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights  
- Model training using various ML algorithms  
- Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization  
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **ML Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
- **Ensemble methods**: random forests, AdaBoost classifier, etc. 
- **Platform**:Google Colab  

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation contains **features such as**:
- Applicant Income  
- Loan Amount  
- Credit History  
- Employment Status  
- Debt-to-Income Ratio
